You have been assigned to make your own zombie!

You are a patient at an insane asylum where the patients have been turned into zombies to be tested on to find a cure. You get to choose your diagnosis and backstory. Attached is a character sheet to fill out the info of your character. When you are finished filling everything out, please email a copy of it to me so I can hand it out to you on the day of the murder. Otherwise, you are responsible for bringing your own filled out a sheet to the party.

On the second page of the character sheet is a vague description of the murder. Zombies will have to give their take and do a short speech on the murder. I am providing this so you can prep a head of time. It should not spoil anything but you can choose to not look at it if you want, and can write it during the murder mystery (there should be a short break with some time) or wing it.

No matter what you chose, you are insane, so your memory of the events is not always right, so be as creative and untruthful with your description as you want. 

This role requires work and creativity on your part. If you donâ€™t want to do this let me (Sierra) know and I will assign you an already written character. 

To recap I need the following from you at least 1 week before the murder mystery:
- copy of filled out character sheet (for me to print out and give to you)
- a description of your diagnosis
